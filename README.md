# Quantum-ML-EEG-Signals
This is a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Project where I build a quantum classifier to classify EEG signals into different frequencies.

Find the dataset here: https://data.mendeley.com/v1/datasets/px9dpkssy8/draft?a=7140665d-a0f0-40b2-a9fd-a731d21b6222

## File / Folder Descriptions:
**QML_Code.ipynb**: File that encodes classical data of the given dataset into encoded data fit for QML.
